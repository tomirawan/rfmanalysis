This project is about analyzing customers behaviour and classify them based on :
* How recently a customer has made a purchase (R).
* How often a customer makes a purchase (F).
* How much money a customer spends on purchases (M).

With the analysis, we can indicate customer engangement, retention, and customer's lifetime value.

###### Disclaimer : This is just for fun project. Don't use it as a real-case implementation! Do your own research :)
