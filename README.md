## This project is about doing RFM analysis on e-commerce purchase dataset from Kaggle.

In this project, I'm using PostgreSQL for wrangling the dataset, and Power BI to visualize the result.

RFM analysis is about analyzing customers behaviour and classify them based on :
* How recently a customer has made a purchase (R).
* How often a customer makes a purchase (F).
* How much money a customer spends on purchases (M).

With the analysis, we can indicate customer engangement, retention, and customer's lifetime value.

##### ***Disclaimer*** : This is just for fun project. Don't use it as a real-case implementation! Do your own research :)
